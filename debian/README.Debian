icecast2 for Debian
-------------------

It is recommended to run icecast under a dedicated user account, which only
has access to write the log files.  The Debian package creates such an
account, named 'icecast', and uses it by default, but you are free to
reconfigure it and remove the account.

Edit /etc/default/icecast2 to change the init-script configuration.
