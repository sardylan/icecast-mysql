icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030802-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 'watch' file to automate tracking of updates.
  * Now uses dh-buildinfo to store information about the package build
    environment.  Added a Build-Dependancy to dh-buildinfo.
  * Removed cdbs/autotools-vars.mk, from cdbs CVS, because a new release
    was made.
  * Enabled curl during configure stage, since --disable-curl was recently
    broken upstream, and potentially broken YP support can be disabled at
    runtime.
  * Trimmed ancient upgrade nodes and other cruft, left over from
    pre-Debian versions, from README.Debian.
  * Removed some autotools build cruft, since bugs were fixed upstream.
  * Normalized {preinst,postinst,postrm} filenames to
    icecast2.{preinst,postinst,postrm}.  Thanks to Emmanuel le Chevoir
    for this suggestion.
  * Fixed preinst; was stopping /usr/bin/icecast instead of
    /usr/bin/icecast2.  Thanks to Emmanuel le Chevoir for this suggestion.
  * Removed prerm, since it was not serving any purpose.  Thanks to
    Emmanuel le Chevoir for this suggestion.
  * Cleaned up postinst: removed old comments, fixed a path typo in the
    configuration file location change message.
  * Cleaned up postrm: removed old comments, fixed a typo in the group
    removal test.
  * Thanks to Jonas Smedegaard for sponsoring this package, and
    providing many good suggestions.

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030714-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sponsored upload. Closes: Bug#178160.
  * Switch to cdbs (agreed with maintainer).
  * Use cdbs autotools-vars.mk from CVS to avoid cross-compiling on same
    host.
  * Add build-dependency on libxml2-dev.
  * Explicitly configure without curl support to avoid building broken
    YP stuff.
  * Hack src/Makefile.am to use AM_CFLAGS instead of CFLAGS (which is
    overridden by cdbs), and add clean rule to avoid invoking automake.
  * Disable daemon by default and hint about changing passwords before
    enabling.
  * Avoid moving config files from pre-Debian times - instead just print
    a warning if config exists in old location (better mess as little as
    possible with files not ever claimed to be ours).
  * Update README.Debian to reflect the above, include note about YP
    support not compiled in, and remove note regarding adoption.
  * Strip paths from packaging scripts (they may move around in the
    future, and if PATH is wrong then something else broken anyway).
  * Avoid removing unused /usr/share/icecast2 on purge.
  * Remove icecast group on purge only if empty.
  * Standards-version 3.6 (no changes needed).
  * Fix wrong escaping of sed vars in conf/Makefile.
  * Symlink public files from /usr/share/icecast2 to /etc/icecast2
    (instead of pointing public root dirs below /etc).
  * Use upstream config (paths are properly included now).

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030714-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New daily snapshot build.
  * Updated versioning scheme to reflect (as well as possible) that the 
    source is a daily snapshot now, not CVS.

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphacvs030704-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Constructed a build script to completely automate the construction
    of the 'pristine' tarball from CVS.  This doesn't really effect the
    contents of the package, just makes it easier for me to rebuild.
  * New CVS source.
  * Removed Build-Dependancy on libcurl2-dev; packages built without this
    library present will not have YP functionality, which is okay for
    now since it's badly broken.
  * Updated the default configuration file, including some new options
    recently added upstream.
  * Added a number of tweaks to clean up and rearrange new configuration
    and documentation added to upstream install target.
  * Moved the configuration file from /etc/icecast.xml to
    /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml.  See README.Debian.
  * Nice ugly version number to reflect that upstream calls this the 2.0
    alpha branch, without potentially introducing the need for an epoch.
